# uwu-discord-bot
This is a discord bot that replies "uwu" to any message containing "uwu" and replies "owo" to any message containing "owo." The bot will additionally respond to greetings.

I used [CodeMentor's tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/@garethdwyer/building-a-discord-bot-with-python-and-repl-it-miblcwejz) to help me figure out how to begin the project and how to deploy it. I was (and still am) interested in learnign how Discord bots work and how I could make a more complex bot in the future.
